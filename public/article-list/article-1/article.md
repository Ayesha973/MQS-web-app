The MUN Quant Society is proud to present our in-house Backtest Engine, a sophisticated platform designed for the rigorous evaluation of quantitative trading strategies. Developed entirely by society members, this engine provides a robust framework for simulating strategy performance against historical market data, serving as a cornerstone project for applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

## Core Features

Our Backtest Engine is engineered to provide detailed insights into strategy viability. Key capabilities include:

- **Extended Historical Analysis:** Strategies can be tested over a **5-year historical window**, offering a comprehensive view of performance across various market regimes.
- **High-Resolution Data:** The engine operates with **minute-by-minute market data granularity**. This incredible resolution allows for precise simulation of trade executions and a more accurate assessment of intraday strategy dynamics.
- **Modular Design:** Built with flexibility in mind, the engine's architecture allows for the integration of diverse strategy types and potential future enhancements. We leverage Python, utilizing libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and potentially NumPy for numerical operations, ensuring efficient data handling.

## Data Source and Coverage

Reliable data is paramount for meaningful backtesting.

- **Data Provider:** We source our historical market data from **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)**, a reputable provider of financial data APIs.
- **Market Focus:** The current iteration of the engine provides extensive coverage for the **US equities market**. This allows members to test strategies on a wide range of US stocks.

## Key Metrics & Visualizations

A crucial aspect of backtesting is the analysis of performance and risk. Our framework automatically generates the following key metrics and supports their visualization:

- **Asset Correlations:** Understanding how individual assets within the strategy move relative to each other.
- **Asset Returns:** Tracking the performance of individual assets targeted by the strategy.
- **Asset Drawdowns:** Measuring the peak-to-trough decline for individual assets.
- **Portfolio Risk:** Quantifying the overall risk exposure of the portfolio generated by the strategy (e.g., using metrics like Standard Deviation or Value at Risk (VaR)).
- **Portfolio Drawdowns:** Assessing the maximum peak-to-trough decline for the entire portfolio's equity curve.
- **Portfolio Volatility:** Measuring the dispersion of returns for the portfolio over time.
- **Aggregated Statistics:** Compiling overall performance figures such as Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), and Maximum Drawdown.

## Technical Architecture Considerations

The engine is designed considering the computational demands of processing high-frequency data over long periods. While specific implementation details evolve, the design prioritizes:

- **Vectorization:** Where possible, operations are vectorized using libraries like Pandas and NumPy to maximize computational efficiency compared to iterative approaches.
- **Event-Driven Potential:** For strategies requiring intricate handling of time progression and order execution simulation, an event-driven approach might be employed or considered for future versions. This simulates the flow of market data tick-by-tick or bar-by-bar.

## Conclusion

The Backtest Engine is a testament to the practical skills and collaborative spirit within the MUN Quant Society. It provides members with an invaluable tool for developing, testing, and refining quantitative trading ideas using realistic market data and industry-standard performance metrics. This project not only enhances members' technical skills in programming and data analysis but also deepens their understanding of financial markets and quantitative strategy development. We are continuously working to improve its capabilities and expand its coverage.
